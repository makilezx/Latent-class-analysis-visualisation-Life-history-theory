# Latent class analysis & visualisation [K-SF-42 questionnaire; Life history theory]

K-SF-42 is a questionnaire developed as the psychometric operationalisation of Life history theory.

Code calculates Cronbach's alpha coefficients over questionnaire scales, followed by latent class analysis (LCA) for identifying different groups (or subtypes) of subjects/cases based on their patterns of answers. 

Furthermore, the *predictive power* of personality types (versus personality dimensions) is visualized. 

Overall, analyses are carried out using R, and visualisations using Python (matplotlib; pictures 2, 3).  Tableau was used for additional visualisation of clustering (picture 1).
