# Latent class analysis & visualization 


*Utilizing insights from 2020. scientific study, code in this repository delves into the intriguing intersection of Life History Theory (LHT) and basic personality traits. 

It provides an in-depth exploration into the manifestation of personality traits within clusters derived from previously obtained LHT scores. 

Furthermore, the repository examines distinctions among diverse clustering solutions generated by latent class analysis and cluster analysis.*


## Introduction

Life History Theory (LHT) has emerged as a pivotal framework within the expansive landscape of the psychology of individual differences. Rooted in evolutionary biology, this theory has been shown, through previous research, to interconnect with various psychological constructs, notably personality traits.

## Aim

The primary goal of the analyses presented here is to explore latent classes within the context of LHT and investigate their relationships with fundamental personality traits. 


## Data

The sample consisted of 1049 participants. Before analysis, the dataset underwent cleaning and preprocessing. Univariate and multivariate outliers were removed, and missing data were imputed using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm within SPSS. Prior to that, Little's test was conducted to ensure the adequacy of the imputation process and the reliability of the dataset for subsequent analyses. 

For general data manipulation in R, the packages `tidyr` and `dplyr` were utilized. Additionally, Python libraries `numpy` and `pandas` were employed intermittently for similar tasks.

## Analysis 

Summation scores were computed utilizing the R `psych` package. The code also performs calculations of Cronbach's alpha coefficients across questionnaire scales.

Subsequently, the R code in this repository employs the `mclust` package to conduct latent class analysis (LCA). This analysis aims to unveil distinct groups or subtypes of subjects by examining their response patterns. Within the LCA, the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) suggested a 5-class solution as the most optimal clustering solution, which served as a starting point for a detailed examination.

In fact, utilizing LHT scores, the latent class analysis reveals the identification of five distinct classes: *Moderate LHT; High parental relationship quality; Slow LHT; Low parental relationship quality; Slow LHT â€“ low romantic partner attachment quality* (Picture 1).

Tableau has been integrated for supplementary visualizations, particularly in illustrating isolated classes (Picture 1). The distribution of personality traits within these identified classes was thoroughly examined and visualized using Python libraries `seaborn` and `matplotlib` (Picture 2). 

Additionally, cluster analysis is carried out to compare with the primary LCA solution from earlier, driven by curiosity. Visualization comparing LCA and cluster analysis was created using the `factoextra` and `gridExtra` packages (Picture 3)



Also, the code visualizes *the predictive power* of personality types versus personality dimensions, employing Python (`seaborn`) for visualizations (Pictures 4 and 5).
