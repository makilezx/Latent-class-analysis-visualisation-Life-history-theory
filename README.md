# Latent class analysis & visualisation [K-SF-42 questionnaire; Life history theory]


*Utilizing insights from a 2020. scientific study (Oljača & Milošević), this repository delves into the intriguing intersection of Life History Theory (LHT) and the K-SF-42 questionnaire.*


## Introduction

Within the expansive landscape of the psychology of individual differences, Life History Theory (LHT) has emerged as a pivotal framework. Rooted in evolutionary biology, this theory has been shown, through previous research, to interconnect with various psychological constructs, notably personality traits.

## Aim

The primary goal of the analyses presented here is to explore latent classes within the context of LHT and investigate their relationships with fundamental personality traits. Utilizing K-SF-42 questionnaire scores, the latent class analysis (LCA) reveals the identification of five distinct classes: Moderate LHT; High parental relationship quality; *Slow LHT; Low parental relationship quality; Slow LHT – low romantic partner attachment quality*.

## Analysis Method

The code performs calculations of Cronbach's alpha coefficients across questionnaire scales, followed by latent class analysis (LCA) to unveil diverse groups or subtypes of subjects based on their response patterns. 

Also, the code visualizes *the predictive power* of personality types versus personality dimensions, employing R for analyses and Python (matplotlib) for visualizations (pictures 2 and 3). 

Tableau has been integrated for supplementary visualizations, particularly in illustrating clustering (picture 1). Additional analyses involve MANOVA for a comprehensive understanding of group differences and the Games-Howell test for post hoc examinations.
