# Latent class analysis & visualisation [K-SF-42 questionnaire; Life history theory]

K-SF-42 is a questionnaire developed as the psychometric operationalisation of Life history theory.

R code calculates Cronbach's alpha coefficients over questionnaire scales, followed by latent class analysis (LCA) for identifying different groups (or subtypes) of subjects/cases based on their patterns of answers. Furthermore, the predictive power of personality types is visualized (versus dimensions). 

R is used for analysis, while Python libraries (seaborn, matplotlib) are applied for visualisation.
